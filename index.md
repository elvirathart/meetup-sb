## Profile

Elvira is a creative and solution-oriented professional and personality. She knows what she wants, why and can communicate this well. 
What started out as learning HTML and CSS to be able to build her own website led to more interest in IT. Nowadays, she can program in TypeScript and Python, is familiar with load testing and has successfully completed several assignments, including one at PwC.<br />Her ambition is to keep learning and broadening her technical knowledge, she is hoping to be challenged with different assignments/problems.<br />Before being lured into IT Elvira worked as an independent fashion designer. Her work balanced on the border of art and fashion. She developed a way to execute designs with a laser cutter. The result: being mentioned in schoolbooks /magazines, a design worn by Lady Gaga and featured in an exhibition #Techstyle at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

## Work Experience


`aug. 2023 - sep. 2023`
__Emendis__

*Test Automation Architect*
<br /><br />
Created POC for efficient test coverage insights.<br />Management needs an overview of test coverage (line, functions, methods, branch) across projects. Solution needs to work for all repositories – different languages and test runners. Current script is unreliable and complex.<br />Proposed solution: simplify the process. Instead of dedicating a run solely to gather coverage, the reports should be gathered when the tests are run on push.  
Suitable tools support line coverage only, which is enough for management overview. However, detailed coverage should be directly visible within the repositories. This can be done by creating badges in the README file.  
<br /><br />

`jul. 2022 - sep. 2023`
__PwC__

*Test Automation Engineer*
<br /><br />
Supported team of PwC ‘Assisted Writing’: development of system for supporting accountants/ PwC employees with their work. Making it possible to search data from several providers, keeping up to date with critical changes regarding relevant laws, connecting law and related articles and making it possible to process this information in a document editor.
<br />

- Migrated test cases from old, non-functioning Selenium framework written in Java to Webdriver.io witting in Typescript.
- Created End to End test automation set from scratch with Webdriver.io and TypeScript.Migrated from inheritance to composition. Conscious decision as it suits test code well, easy to maintain and handover to others. Also suited the PwC application much better. 
- Specifics of chosen programming style: revealing (composed) module pattern – functional programming (instead of OOP) with revealing modules (instead of classes).
- Determined coverage
- Defined test cases and flow.
- Cucumber collaboration
- Created tests for Google, Firefox and Selenium Grid. Nightly run in Jenkins pipeline.
- Created a (python/bash) script to automatically generate the release notes by getting and combining information from GitHub and Jira.
- On request release notes needed to be made by combining numbers from GitHub and their corresponding ticket titles in Jira. Before this was done manually, after optimizing and automating this process it took seconds instead of hours.
- Created a Load test in Locust (python) to identify performance issues (and later confirmed they were fixed). Test run on development, acceptance and production environment.
PwC did not have the resources or time to hire a professional performance tester, so I took the opportunity to pick this up.<br />
Prepared a Load test for the US environment including instructions on how to set up and execute the test for the US team. Was successfully executed.<br />
Working in agile sprints. Supported team by testing ‘ready for test’ tickets for every release. Responsible for release notes. 
<br /><br />

`aug. 2022`
__Valori__

*Test Automation Architect*
<br /><br />
Workshop and Demo - Playwright 
After working with Playwright I was asked to give a demo about my experience with Playwright and Cypress to the senior Architects of Valori. This turned into not only a demo with code snippets and showing the possibilities of Playwright but a hands-on workshop with assignment.  
<br /><br />

`may 2022 - jul. 2022`
__Keana__

*Test Automation Engineer*
<br /><br />
Supported team of Keana, development of web based TMS by creating an end-to-end automation test using Playwright. 
 <br />

- Define test cases and flow 
- Determine coverage 
- BDD using testing-library 
- Accessibility testing 
- Suggest test-ability improvements to developers 
- Tool selection: proposed to use Playwright over Cypress. <br />As POC executed part of the test in both Playwright and Cypress to show the advantages in this project
