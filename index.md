# Component Testing with Storybook


<br />

## Setup instructions:

Use your IDE of choice - we prefer VSCode
<br />
Make sure you have Node installed: version 18.17.0
<br />
<br />

Clone the repository:
<br />

__git clone git@github.com:elvirathart/Meetup.git__

<br />
<br />

__npm install__
<br />
<br />
If you now get the error that you are still missing the module @reduxjs/toolkit:
<br />

__npm install @reduxjs/toolkit__
<br />
<br />

__npm run dev__
<br />
open localhost:3000 and continue with the instructions you find there...
